This code will drive WS2811 pixels using the FastLED library. It is designed to run on a Teensy 3.2. It receives data over Serial from an ESP8266/ESP32. 

Serial port 1 is used for connection to ESP8266.  Serial over the USB connection is used for debugging.

The OctoWS2811 parallel output is being used to drive 8 output pins. 

I included standby pixel displays for when no data is being received. 

I am using a DS1307 real time clock module to keep time and turn the standby functions on and off during certain hours of the day.
