This sketch allows for control of FastLED pixels and Disney Glow with the Show Ears via E1.31 (SACN) or Artnet. It includes a power on self test function to make sure everything is connected properly when the Arduino boots and a standby function to run when no data is being received.

The FastLED and GWTS libraries must be installed in the Arduino IDE.

The sketch requires the ethernet shield.
